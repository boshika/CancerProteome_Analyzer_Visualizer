## Abstract
Proteomics is the study of protein that includes protein function and structure. One of the main objectives of this field is to explore the 3D structure of proteins. This application utilizes the main objective of proteomics. The user can explore a specific set of genes involved in cancer.  It allows users to access information about that specific biomolecule, and run basic analysis and visualize its models.

Specific Objectives
-   Users can access pre-populated data such as features, gene ontology, cross-references on certain genes that are involved in cancer
-   User can select certain aspects of the protein to explore, such as looking at spatial distribution of the protein chains, a basic computation of the molecular distances, and 3D structure of the protein
